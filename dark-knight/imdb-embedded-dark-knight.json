That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn\u0027t enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we\u0027ll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale\u0027s Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. \"The Dark Knight\" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.",
